### Hey there, fellow explorer! 

Abhishek here, trying to make my Github look more fancier than yesterday. 
If you like my projects, please drop a star. It motivates me to write better READMEs :p

#### What am I upto these days?

- Project: Adhrit
- Topics: Bytecode analysis, device farm detection techniques

#### Contributions welcome:

* Frontend hacks for Adhrit (AngularJS)
* UI updates for Adhrit
* You have a better logo?
